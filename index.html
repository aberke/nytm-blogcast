	<p>A blogcast widget is intended to be to be placed on a blogpost or article by the post's author.  Blogcast adds a radio show element to print.</p>


	<p>Blogcast allows an author to hold a question and answer session for the readers of the post.  The conversations that result from this session are recorded, and the chosen conversations are combined into a podcast that is then accessible from the original article.</p>

	<p><strong>Here's how it works:</strong></p>

	<p>An author of an article, just like this one, decides to invite readers to ask her questions about her article.</p>

	<p>She goes to create a new blogcast at <a target="_blank" href="http://patronus-petri.dotcloud.com/">http://patronus-petri.dotcloud.com</a>.  When she logs in, she sees all of the blogcasts she has previously created.  She opts to create a new one.</p>

	<p>She enters her email only so that she can recieve a notification each time a readers signs up to participate in her blogcast.</p>

	<p>I'm taking the <a target="_blank" href="http://m.c.lnkd.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrink_200_200/p/2/000/1f7/2b9/32958f1.jpg">URL to my headshot from LinkedIn</a>.</p>

	<p>The reader selects a date and time at which she will hold her blogcast.</p>
	
<div onclick="blogcastWidgetModule.scrollToBlogcast()" id="blogcast-widget-teaser"></div>

	<p>Upon creation of the blogcast, she is provided with code to embed the blogcast widget on her article, as well as an optional "teaser widget".</p>

	<p>She includes these snippets on her article so that readers will see a form inviting them to ask her a question.  Ask me a question!</p>

	<p>The author has a portal from which she accesses the questions.</p>

	<p>She can discard the questions she does not want to answer, and the reader that registered for the question will be notified that their question was not selected.</p>

	<p>Right before it is time for her blogcast, she clicks a button to "screen" her callers.  This way she does not waste her time trying to reach people that are no longer available.</p>

	<p>She can optionally record an introduction to her blogcast.</p>

	<p>She calls her readers from her browser by simply clicking the call button.  The conversation they proceed to have is recorded.  She can play back any conversation, and if she doesn't think one is inciteful, she can discard it.</p>

	<p>When she's done, she clicks to "build" the blogcast.  The build process uploads each recording as a soundcloud track, and creates a soundcloud playlist to include all of the tracks in her blogcast.</p>

	<p>Once built, she is provided with an interface from which she can customize her blogcast widget.</p>

	<p>Now when readers go to her article, instead of seeing a form to sign up for the blogcast within the widget, they see the blogcast itself and can listen directly from the page.</p>
